# Breast Cancer Detection

## Problem Statement:

"The objective of this project is investigating the probability of predicting the chances of breast cancer from the given characteristics of breast mass computed from the
dataset".

## Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form
tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.

The key challenge against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant(cancerous) or benign(non cancerous).

#### Dataset Information
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/breast-cancer-dataset

The Dataset contains 32 Columns and 570 rows consisting all the parameters used for detecting a Breast Cancer.

The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet, obtained from Kaggle, contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass and describe
characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

### Model Used

1.Logistic Regression 

2.Support Vector Machine(SVM)

3.Random Forest

4.Decision Tree
